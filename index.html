<p><em>They call me Erkan. Here, is my story.</em>  <a href='#tldr'>TLDR</a></p>

<h3>Operating System?</h3>
<p>Chemical Engineer B.Sc. earned at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) Germany. During my studies I was able to complete internships at:</p>
<ul>
<li>a crude oil refinery in Germany</li>
<li>a polyurethane corporation in China</li>
<li>many part time jobs and consulting</li>

</ul>
<h3>How did <code>~/$ </code> happen?</h3>
<p>Solving course requirements I got introduced to work with Matlab. I had disks full of spread sheets which I wasn&#39;t able to maintain anymore. So I was asking myself whether I could apply Matlab on that terrain aswell.</p>
<h3>That&#39;s not all. Is it?</h3>
<p>No, that&#39;s where it all started. As a side quest I worked on calculating benchmarks for (financial) options. Something I intended to do. But was unable to accomplish with spread sheets and VBA.</p>
<p>At a later point in time I decided to offer the calculation results and reports based on the results to selected people, which they seemed to like.</p>
<p>It is convenient to have a set of default plots ready to consume, to share or to build upon. However,  changing the question usually require a new set of plots. This in turn requires access to the underlying data. While distributing HDF5 or CSV files was not an issue, keeping track of versions would have been a nightmare. Building a RESTful web API was the solution I favored.</p>
<p>A prerequisite for an Web API would be database. Database, back end,  front end. That&#39;s a little more than Matlab/Octave could offer. Obviously the solution had do be  ... <em>something completely different</em>.</p>
<h3>The ingredients?</h3>
<ul>
<li>cloud VMs acting as scalable (virtual) physical devices</li>
<li><code>Postgres</code> to store and distribute data</li>
<li>(scientific) Python stack to shape and mold the data</li>
<li><code>flask</code> as a lightweight extensible micro framework connecting front and back end</li>
<li><code>plotly.js</code> / <code>dash</code> for reactive single page apps wrapped with <code>Dash</code></li>

</ul>
<h3>But, that was not within your curriculum. Was it? </h3>
<p>The Python community offers great resources like books, tutorials, and PyCon recordings.</p>
<p>Reading source code of successful projects is an other way of learning the style, coding patterns and the API of related packages. </p>
<h3>Topics you can offer turn key solutions for?</h3>
<p>Generally speaking I can build results around:</p>
<ul>
<li>the scientific Python stack (Scipy, NumPy, Matplotlib)</li>
<li>code migration from Matlab to Python or advice on how to do it complete wrong</li>
<li>basic database design, creation, migration, maintenance (SQLite, MySQL, Postgres)</li>
<li>typical ETL operations</li>
<li>prototyping, single page apps, data viz, reports, GUIs </li>
<li>RESTful web APIs</li>
<li>deployment and operation </li>

</ul>

<li><a href='https://app.volsurf.com'>app.volsurf.com</a>  demo app. consumes for the volsurf API </li>
<li><a href='https://github.com/erkandem/multi-dump-restore'>multi-dump-restore</a>  backup/restore automation</li>

</ul>
<h3>What&#39;s on the bucket list?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rust</li>
<li>more of Vue!</li>
<li>more of fastapi</li>
<li>ansible</li>
</ul>
